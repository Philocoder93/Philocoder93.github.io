  <h1>Hi, I'm Isaac Duarte</h1>
  <p class="big-text">
    I'm a philosopher turned web developer working in the Washington D.C. area. I have a deep seated passion for the technical and arcane. Every day I strive to communicate in a clear and honest manner. I love to tame complex problems with careful analysis and endless persistence.
